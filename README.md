## Examples

### Jet Aircraft Analysis
```python

object_type = "Jet Aircraft"
length = 15.0  # meters
width = 3.0    # meters  
height = 2.0   # meters
angle_of_attack = 5.0  # degrees

# Set wind conditions
wind_speed = 50.0  # m/s
wind_angle = 180.0  # head-on wind

# Expected results:
# - Low drag coefficient (~0.02-0.05)
# - Significant lift at angle of attack
# - High L/D ratio for efficiency
```

diameter = 1.0  # meters
mass = 10.0     # kg

# Set conditions
wind_speed = 0.0    # still air
gravity = True      # include gravity

# Expected results:
# - Terminal velocity calculation
# - Reynolds number transition effects
# - Classic sphere drag curve
```

### Custom 3D Geometry Import
```python
# Using the GUI:
# 1. Select "Import 3D Mesh" from Object Type dropdown
# 2. Click "Import 3D Geometry..." button
# 3. Choose your OBJ, STL, or PLY file
# 4. Configure scaling and aerodynamic properties
# 5. Import and run simulation

# Supported file formats:
# - OBJ: Wavefront OBJ files with vertices and faces
# - STL: Stereolithography files (ASCII and Binary)
# - PLY: Polygon File Format

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. **GUI Not Appearing**: Check PySide6 installation
3. **Slow Performance**: Reduce time step or grid resolution
4. **Memory Issues**: Clear data periodically for long simulations
5. **Plots Not Showing**: Data plots update automatically during and after simulation
6. **3D Import Fails**: Ensure mesh files are valid and not corrupted
7. **Large Mesh Files**: Consider mesh optimization for files with >10k vertices

### Performance Tips
- Use appropriate time steps (0.001-0.01 seconds)
- Limit simulation duration for real-time analysis
- Close unused visualization tabs
- Monitor system resources during long runs
